This is unofficial implementation of the paper.
We just reorganize the code and reimplement the LightTrackM.  
Official verision is as follows:

## Demo
We just provide demo.py for shoes-dynamic4.mp4.
```
cd tracking
python demo.py --cfg ../experiments/LightTrack.yaml --video ../demo/shoes-dynamic4.mp4
```
